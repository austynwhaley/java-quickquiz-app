## Description

Had a lot of fun with this assignment, getting the chance to format and style from scratch taught me a lot more than what I thought I already knew. I did kind of have an issue with condencing the choice buttons while also keeping them centered so I instead kept them the width they're at now, its not super perfect but I dont think its a terrible eyesore. The hardest part(s) of the assignment for me I'd say was the high scores and setting them with a name attached. Truth be told there is some coding syntax and methods in my code I discovered while googling unrelentlessly that we haven't gone over in class too much. I'm really starting to notice with every assignment, how many differnt ways you can go about just programming one small detail.
